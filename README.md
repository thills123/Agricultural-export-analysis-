# Agricultural-export-analysis-
Nigeria, a major player in the global agricultural export market, aims to diversify its economy by expanding agricultural exports. However, the country faces challenges in optimizing its export strategy due to limited insights into destination-specific, product-specific, and company-specific performance.
The primary challenge is to analyze the agricultural export data to understand the distribution of export volume, units sold, and profits across key dimensions (destination country, product, and production company). This will help identify opportunities to increase market share, optimize product portfolios, and improve overall profitability.

 

2. Objectives

Understand Performance Distribution: Evaluate export performance across destination countries, products, and production companies.
Identify Opportunities: Highlight underperforming markets, high-margin products, and efficient production companies.
Strategic Recommendations: Develop strategies to increase export efficiency, market penetration, and profitability.
 

3. Data Requirements
